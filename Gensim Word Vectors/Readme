#📰 News Classification using Gensim Word Vectors

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Gensim Word2Vec embeddings and machine learning models.

#Project Overview

This project demonstrates text classification using word embeddings. The workflow:
Load and combine Fake and Real news datasets.
Preprocess text (tokenization, lowercasing, removing stopwords).
Convert words into Word2Vec embeddings using Gensim.
Generate document vectors (average of word vectors per article).
Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
